## üîß Configuration

### Manual Workflow Triggers

You can customize the analysis through workflow dispatch inputs:

#### CodeQL Security Analysis
- **Languages**: Comma-separated list of languages to analyze
- **Security Level**: `standard`, `extended`, or `comprehensive`
- **Create Issues**: Automatically create GitHub issues for findings

#### Workflow Security Validation
- Runs automatically on workflow changes
- Can be triggered manually anytime
- Provides detailed security validation reports

### Security Configuration

The system uses `.github/security-config.yml` to define:
- Security standards and requirements
- CodeQL configuration and thresholds
- Dependabot ecosystem settings
- Validation rules and exemptions
- Reporting preferences
- Branch protection requirements

## üîç Security Checks

### CodeQL Analysis
- **Query Suites**: Security-and-quality, Security-extended
- **Path Exclusions**: Automatically excludes `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`, test directories
- **Language-Specific Setup**: Automatic dependency installation for accurate analysis
- **Security Focus**: Prioritizes security-related code patterns and vulnerabilities

### Dependabot Monitoring
- **Security Advisories**: Automatic monitoring of all configured ecosystems
- **Coordinated Updates**: All updates scheduled for Monday 6 AM UTC
- **Review Assignment**: Automatic assignment to repository maintainers
- **Security Labeling**: All dependency updates tagged with security labels

### Workflow Validation
- **Permissions Check**: Ensures least privilege principle
- **Pull Request Target Safety**: Validates safe usage patterns
- **Script Injection Prevention**: Detects potential command injection vectors
- **Secret Detection**: Identifies potential hardcoded credentials
- **Security Integration**: Recommends security scanning for substantial workflows

## üìä Reporting and Monitoring

### Security Reports
- **Location**: Generated in `security-reports/` directory
- **Formats**: JSON (machine-readable), Markdown (human-readable)
- **Retention**: 30 days via GitHub Actions artifacts
- **Accessibility**: Available as workflow run artifacts

### Automated Actions
1. **Critical/High Findings**: Automatically creates GitHub issues
2. **PR Comments**: Security validation results on pull requests
3. **Workflow Failures**: Fails builds on critical security issues
4. **Regular Summaries**: Weekly security status updates

### Dashboard and Metrics
- **Security Dashboard**: Overview of all security findings and status
- **Historical Trends**: Track security improvements over time
- **Coverage Metrics**: Languages analyzed, dependencies monitored
- **Compliance Status**: Alignment with security standards

## üö¶ Usage

### Getting Started
1. The system activates automatically on:
   - Push to main/master/develop branches
   - Pull requests to main branches
   - Weekly schedule (Mondays 6 AM UTC)
   - Manual workflow dispatch

2. **First Run**: The system will:
   - Detect project languages automatically
   - Initialize CodeQL analysis
   - Validate existing workflows
   - Generate baseline security reports

3. **Ongoing Operations**:
   - Weekly CodeQL scans
   - Daily workflow validation
   - Dependabot updates as available
   - Automated issue creation for findings

### Manual Triggers
```bash
# Trigger security analysis manually
gh workflow run codeql-security-analysis.yml

# Validate workflow security
gh workflow run workflow-security-validation.yml

# Custom language analysis
gh workflow run codeql-security-analysis.yml \
  -f languages="python,javascript" \
  -f security_level="comprehensive" \
  -f create_issues="true"
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### For Repository Maintainers
1. **Review Security Reports**: Check weekly security summaries
2. **Address Critical Findings**: Prioritize critical/high severity issues
3. **Validate Dependabot PRs**: Review dependency updates for breaking changes
4. **Monitor Workflow Changes**: Ensure new workflows pass security validation
5. **Update Dependencies**: Keep security tooling updated

### For Contributors
1. **Follow Workflow Standards**: Ensure PRs pass security validation
2. **Use Secure Patterns**: Avoid hardcoded secrets and unsafe shell commands
3. **Test Locally**: Run security checks before pushing
4. **Review Security Feedback**: Address workflow security recommendations

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding Languages
1. Update `detect-languages` job in `codeql-security-analysis.yml`
2. Add language detection patterns
3. Update security configuration if needed

### Modifying Security Thresholds
Edit `.github/security-config.yml`:
```yaml
codeql:
  thresholds:
    critical: 0    # Fail on any critical findings
    high: 5        # Fail if more than 5 high-severity findings
    medium: 20     # Warn if more than 20 medium-severity findings
```

### Exempting Workflows
Add workflow names to security configuration:
```yaml
validation_rules:
  exemptions:
    - "my-utility-workflow.yml"
    - "documentation-build.yml"
```

## üìà Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Security Coverage**: Multi-language analysis with dependency monitoring
2. **Automated Validation**: Continuous security checking without manual intervention
3. **Early Detection**: Catch security issues before they reach production
4. **Developer-Friendly**: Clear feedback and actionable recommendations
5. **Compliance Ready**: Structured reporting for audit and compliance needs
6. **Scalable**: Supports projects of any size with configurable thresholds

## üîß Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review monthly security summaries
- Update security thresholds based on project needs
- Validate exempted workflows periodically
- Update security tools and actions

### Troubleshooting
- Check workflow logs for detailed error messages
- Review security reports for analysis details
- Validate YAML syntax if workflows fail
- Ensure proper permissions for security operations
